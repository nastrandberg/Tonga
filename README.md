Across the datasets, Cal_yrs_BP refers to the mean calibrated year before present (before 1950 CE). Depth_cm refers to the depth of the sample from the core top in centimetres and site refers to the site the core was collected from. NA values within the Cal_yrs_BP column are because not all pollen samples have an associated date.
